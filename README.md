- 👋 Hi, I’m @brianteokp!
- 👀 I’m interested in immunology, and integrating machine learning in a clinical and healthcare setting.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my MSc in immunology, and taking online courses in both statistics as well as machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that might involve machine learning in healthcare! Im still pretty new overall, and alot of my projects are all simplified analysis of public datasets, but am always looking to improve.
